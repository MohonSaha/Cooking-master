                    <p className='mb-0'><strong>The primary difference between Node.js and Express.js is their purpose.</strong> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript. It provides a runtime environment that is optimized for server-side development and allows developers to write efficient and scalable code.
                        Express.js, on the other hand, is a web application framework that builds on top of Node.js. It provides a set of tools and features that simplify the process of building web and mobile applications. It includes routing, middleware, and template engines that make it easier to build web applications.</p>
                    <p><strong>Another key difference between Node.js and Express.js is their level of abstraction.</strong> Node.js is a lower-level technology that provides developers with access to the underlying system resources. It allows developers to write code that interacts directly with the operating system, network, and file system. Express.js, on the other hand, is a higher-level technology that abstracts away many of the low-level details of web development. It provides a simpler, more streamlined API that makes it easier to build web applications.</p>
